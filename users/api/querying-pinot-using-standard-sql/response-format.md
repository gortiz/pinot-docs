# Query Response Format

Find Pinot query response format examples for selection, aggregation, and group by queries formatted in a [SQL-like structure](response-format.md#standard-sql-response). Also find details about each field included in the Pinot [broker query response](response-format.md#broker-query-response-fields).

To learn more about how a Pinot broker routes and processes queries, computes the query explain plan, and ways to optimize queries, see the following topics:

* [Processing queries](../../../basics/architecture.md#query-processing)
* Query explain plans:
  * [Single-stage query engine](../../user-guide-query/explain-plan.md)
  * [Multi-stage query engine](../../user-guide-query/query-syntax/explain-plan-multi-stage.md)
* [Optimizing query routing](../../../operators/operating-pinot/tuning/routing.md#optimizing-routing)
  * [Use adaptive server selection](../../../operators/operating-pinot/tuning/query-routing-using-adaptive-server-selection.md)

### Standard-SQL response

The query response is returned in a **SQL-like tabular structure** from the standard-SQL endpoint.&#x20;

      <p>A high number for this means the selectivity is low (that is, Pinot needs to scan a lot of records to answer
        the query). If this is high, consider using star-tree index. (A regular inverted/bitmap index won't improve
        performance.)</p></td>
